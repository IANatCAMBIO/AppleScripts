Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, 
I'm not going to make it, 
but you laugh inside
remembering all the times you've felt that way.
#
We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus!
That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't.
We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.
#
That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink.
If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget;
if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate;
and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.
#
The problem with the world is that
the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.
#
there are worse things
than being alone
but it often takes decades
to realize this
and most often when you do
it's too late
and there's nothing worse than too late
#
Sometimes solitude is one of the most beautiful things on earth...
#
The free soul is rare,
but you know it when you see it.
Basically, because you feel good,
very good, when you are near or with them.
#
drink from the well
of your self
and begin
again.
#
The less I needed,
The better I felt...
#
I don't hate people,
I just feel better when they aren't around.
#
If you want to know who your friends are,
get yourself a jail sentence.
#
How in the hell could a person enjoy being awakened at 6:30 A.M.
by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, shit, piss, brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic
to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money 
for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?
#
Find what you love and let it kill you.
#
Slavery was never abolished,
it was only extended to include all the colors.
#
Almost everyone is born a genius and buried an idiot.
#
What matters most is how well you walk through the fire.
#
If you’re losing your soul and you know it, then you’ve still got a soul left to lose.
#
Genius might be the ability to say a profound thing in a simple way.
#
To do a dull thing with style, now that’s what I call art.
#
People are strange. They are constantly angered by trivial things,
but on a major matter like totally wasting their lives,
they hardly seem to notice.
#
We don’t even ask happiness, just a little less pain.
#
I never met another man I'd rather be.
And even if that's a delusion, it's a lucky one.
#
regret is mostly caused by not having
done anything.
#
Frankly, I was horrified by life,
at what a man had to do simply in order to eat, sleep, and keep himself clothed.
So I stayed in bed and drank.
When you drank the world was still out there,
but for the moment it didn’t have you by the throat.
#
the best part was
pulling down the
shades
stuffing the doorbell
with rags
putting the phone
in the
refrigerator
and going to bed
for 3 or 4
days.
and the next best
part
was
nobody ever
missed
me.
#
I see a bright
portion
under the overhead light

that shades into
darkness
and then into darker
darkness
and I can't see beyond that.
#
Sex is kicking death in the ass while singing.
#
Sometimes you just have to pee in the sink.
#
Baby," I said, "I'm a genius but nobody knows it but me.
#
My beerdrunk soul is sadder than all the dead christmas trees of the world.
#
I went to the worst of bars hoping to get killed but all I could do was to get drunk again.
#
The difference between a democracy and a dictatorship is
that in a democracy you vote first and take orders later;
in a dictatorship you don't have to waste your time voting.
#
I'm going, she said. I love you but you're crazy, you're doomed.
#
I carry death in my left pocket.
Sometimes I take it out and talk to it:
"Hello, baby, how you doing? When you coming for me? I'll be ready.
#
Too often the people complain
that they have done nothing with their lives
and then they wait for somebody to tell them
that this isn't so.
#
In the morning it was morning and I was still alive.
#
People run from rain but sit in bathtubs full of water.
#
Any asshole can chase a skirt, art takes discipline.
#
He asked, "What makes a man a writer?"
"Well," I said, "it's simple.
You either get it down on paper, or jump off a bridge.
#
I had noticed that both in the very poor and very rich extremes of society
the mad were often allowed to mingle freely.
#
Nothing is worse than to finish a good shit, then reach over and find the toilet paper container empty.
Even the most horrible human being on earth deserves to wipe his ass.
#
The best often die by their own hand
just to get away,
and those left behind
can never quite understand
why anybody would ever want to get away from them
